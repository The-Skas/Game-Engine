A component based game engine:
===========

This is a component based game engine that is being developed by both Salman AlKhalifa and Bader AlKoheji. 

The project on GitHub portrays some graphical features of particle manipulation which mainly displays the graphic's
system.

===Information===
Controls:

Left/Right Arrow Key: Cycle through the different particles. 
ESC: To quit.
Mouse: (For the Mask Particle System).

          1. The first group of particles is a basic group which are set in a wander state.

          2. The second particle system show cases what should appear to be a top-down view of an ocean through
             perlin noise, as well +32,000 particles stimulated. 

          3. Finally the third just creates a mask that can be moved with the mouse.
